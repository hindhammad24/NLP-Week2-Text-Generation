# Prompt Engineering for Chatbots
Delve into prompt engineering with practical examples for creating chatbots. The links provided will serve as valuable resources for working with existing language models:

LLaMA Notebook: Explore prompt engineering with the LLaMa model in this Colab notebook. Access the LLaMA Notebook

GhatGPT Tutorial: This notebook introduces you to prompt engineering with GPT, implemented in PyTorch. Access the GhatGPT Tutorial

These examples are straightforward and should be easy to follow, offering a hands-on introduction to prompt engineering for chatbots.

# Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to teach the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful approach for creating grounded and context-aware language generation systems.

What You’ll Learn:
- Understand the limitations of standalone language models and how RAG addresses them.
- Build a simple retrieval system using dense embeddings and pandas indexing.
- Integrate retrieval with text generation to create a basic RAG pipeline.
